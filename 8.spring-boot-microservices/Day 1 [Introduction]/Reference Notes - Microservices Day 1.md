ðŸ”µ **Monolithic Application Architecture**     

- Monolithic application holds all modules together and converted as one Service (one .war file).    
- In Monolothic application all components (frontend, backend)are tightly integrated.    
- This approach works well for small to medium-scale applications.    
    
ðŸ”µ **Microservice Application Architecture**    
- Microservices is an architecture style where we develop application having multiple services.    
- Each service is independent or loosely coupled, cloud enabled and deployable.    
- Those services interact with each other and exposed by REST.
- The most important feature of the microservice-based architecture is that it can perform continuous delivery of a large and complex application.

In the above figure, each microservice has its own business layer and database. If we change in one microservice, it does not affect the other services.    
- These services communicate with each other by using lightweight protocols such as HTTP or REST or messaging protocols.
